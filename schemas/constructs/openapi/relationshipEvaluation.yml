              description: If true, only return the diff of changes instead of the complete updated design
            enableTrace:
              type: boolean
              description: If true, include detailed trace information in the response

    EvaluationResponse:

          description: The final evaluated design, including all updated components and relationships. This can be either the complete updated design or only a diff of changes. The version of the design will be automatically incremented if any modifications are made during the evaluation process. This field provides a comprehensive view of the design state after all relationship evaluations and policy applications have been completed.

        evaluationHash:
          type: string
          description: Hash of the input parameters and configuration used for this evaluation. Useful for identifying duplicate evaluations or caching results.
